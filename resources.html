            <h2> Robert Morris: Head Coach</h2>
            <p>Coach Robert Morris, known affectionately by his athletes as Coach Bob, is our team’s head coach. He has accomplished an incredible amount over his 40-plus years of coaching. In 1994, he became assistant coach at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO under 1984 Olympic medalist Dragomir Cioroslan. When women's weightlifting was introduced in 1997, he worked with Lyn Jones to develop the American program, and served as its head coach from 2002 to 2008. In all, Coach Bob brings invaluable perspective and knowledge to our program, and we are very lucky to have him.

            <p>Although we are university-affiliated, we train off campus. Located at 680 State Circle, Wolverine Strength and Conditioning is the gym we call home. With 9 platforms, Werksan Barbells and plates, and a plethora of other equipment, we’re able to take advantage of one of the premier training facilities in the state of Michigan.</p>
